This is the summary of the linear regression to predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The Vehicle_length and the Ground_clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

No, we can notice that the slope of the linear model is not zero, this means that a correlation exist between this variables and the MPG.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, R-squared is 0.7149, so we can say that ther exist a strong correlation between the variables and the MPG
